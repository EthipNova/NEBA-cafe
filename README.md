CUSTOMER FRONTEND
        ↓
REST API
        ↓
BACKEND
        ↓
BUSINESS LOGIC
        ↓
POSTGRESQL DATABASE
        ↓
EXTERNAL SERVICES
   ├── Payment
   └── Notifications


Keep frontend and backend clearly separated.

Do not allow the frontend to directly manipulate the production database.

35. RECOMMENDED TECHNOLOGY

Use a modern production-ready stack.

Frontend

React

TypeScript

Vite

Tailwind CSS

Backend

Node.js

NestJS

TypeScript

Database

PostgreSQL

Prisma ORM

Authentication

Use secure token/session-based authentication.

Testing

Use appropriate unit, integration and end-to-end testing tools.

The exact technology can be adjusted if the existing ORNIX-TECH architecture requires another choice.

36. DATABASE

Design a relational database around:

users
categories
products
orders
order_items
payments
addresses
promotions
notifications


Use:

primary keys

foreign keys

timestamps

indexes where appropriate

constraints

appropriate relationships

Use database migrations.

Do not manually modify production schemas.

37. SECURITY

Implement security from the beginning.

Include:

secure password hashing

authentication

authorization

input validation

API protection

rate limiting where appropriate

secure secrets

HTTPS in production

XSS protection

SQL injection protection

CSRF protection where applicable

secure cookies/tokens

restricted admin access

Never expose:

passwords

JWT secrets

API keys

database credentials

38. ERROR STATES

Every important screen must handle:

loading

success

error

empty state

Examples:

Loading menu...

Product unavailable.

Payment failed. Please try again.

Your cart is empty.

No orders yet.

Do not leave users staring at blank screens.

39. RESPONSIVE DESIGN

The entire website must be responsive.

Prioritize:

Mobile

Primary customer experience.

Tablet

Customer and staff experience.

five-stage timeline animation

dashboard interactions

Avoid excessive animations that make the application feel slow.

42. NAVIGATION

Desktop navigation:

NEBA

Home
Menu
About
Process
Contact

44. CODE ORGANIZATION

Keep the code modular.

Suggested structure:

project/

├── frontend/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── hooks/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── stores/
│   └── types/
│
├── backend/
│   ├── auth/
│   ├── users/
│   ├── products/
│   ├── categories/
│   ├── cart/
│   ├── orders/
│   ├── payments/
│   ├── promotions/
│   ├── notifications/
│   └── administration/
│
├── database/
│   └── migrations/
│
├── tests/
│
└── documentation/


The exact structure may be adjusted according to the selected framework.

45. API DESIGN

Design REST APIs such as:

GET    /api/orders/:id
PATCH  /api/orders/:id/status

POST   /api/payments
GET    /api/payments/:id

GET    /api/admin/dashboard


The exact endpoints can be adjusted during implementation.

46. API CONTRACT

Keep API contracts clear.

Every API should define:

method

endpoint

authentication requirement

request body

validation

response

error responses

permissions

Frontend should consume APIs through a dedicated API/service layer.

47. TESTING

Build testing into the project.

Include:

Unit Tests

Business logic.

Integration Tests

Frontend/backend/database interactions.

API Tests

Endpoint behavior.

End-to-End Tests

Customer ordering journey.

Soft Drinks

Other

Products:

Classic Burger

Cheese Burger

Chicken Burger

Margherita Pizza

Chicken Pizza

French Fries

Coca-Cola

Sprite

Water

Use placeholder prices where official café prices have not yet been provided.

Clearly separate demo data from production data.

53. IMPORTANT BUSINESS RULES

Implement these rules server-side:

Unavailable products cannot be ordered.

Product prices are retrieved from the backend.

Order totals are calculated/validated by the backend.

Customers can only access their own orders.

Staff can only perform authorized operational actions.

Admin functions require administrator authorization.

Payment success must be verified by the backend.

Duplicate order creation must be prevented where appropriate.

Invalid order status transitions must be rejected.

Sensitive information must never be exposed.

54. UX QUALITY

The application should feel polished.

Avoid:

generic templates

excessive cards

unnecessary gradients

tiny text

confusing navigation

inconsistent buttons

cluttered dashboards

excessive animation

placeholder-looking UI

Prioritize:

visual hierarchy

whitespace

typography

consistency

intuitive navigation

clear CTAs

useful feedback

fast interaction

55. DESIGN SYSTEM

Create reusable components:

Button

Input

Select

Modal

Card

ProductCard

CategoryCard

Badge

Toast

LoadingSpinner

EmptyState

ErrorState

Navbar

Footer

OrderStatus

OrderTimeline

DashboardCard

DataTable

Use a consistent design system throughout the application.

56. MOBILE-FIRST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

The customer ordering experience should be optimized primarily for mobile.

The user should be able to:

Open the website.

Immediately see the menu CTA.

Browse products.

Add a product.

Open cart.

Checkout.

Pay.

Track order.

The process should require as few unnecessary steps as possible.

57. ADMIN UX

The admin dashboard should prioritize efficiency.

Staff should be able to identify immediately:

new orders

pending orders

preparing orders

ready orders

unavailable products

payment problems

Use clear status indicators.

58. PERFORMANCE

Optimize:

images

API requests

database queries

frontend bundles

unnecessary re-renders

loading states

Lazy-load appropriate pages/components.

Use optimized image handling.

Do not sacrifice usability for unnecessary optimization.

59. SEO

For public pages implement:

meaningful page titles

meta descriptions

semantic HTML

proper headings

descriptive image alt text

clean URLs

Open Graph metadata where appropriate

Customer-facing pages should be search-engine friendly.

60. FINAL QUALITY STANDARD

Before considering the project complete, verify:

Customer

Home works

Menu works

Categories work

Authentication + authorization

↓

Phase 4

Products + categories

↓

Phase 5

Customer frontend

Phase 8

Payments

↓

Phase 9

Staff dashboard

↓

Phase 10

Admin dashboard

↓

Phase 11

Notifications

↓

Phase 12

Testing

↓

Phase 13

Production preparation

62. DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY

For every feature use:

Requirement
 ↓
Task
 ↓
Feature Branch
 ↓
Implementation
 ↓
Local Testing
 ↓
Code Review
 ↓
Integration
 ↓
Integration Testing
 ↓
Merge


Use meaningful Git commits.

Example:

feat: implement product management

63. FINAL WEBSITE EXPERIENCE

When a visitor enters the website, they should immediately understand:

What is this?

NEBA Café's digital ordering platform.

What can I do?

Browse, order, pay, and track my food.

Who built it?

ORNIX-TECH.

How was it built?

Through a professional five-stage process:

Requirements → Design → Architecture → Development → Testing & Deployment

This should be obvious from the website.

64. FINAL HERO MESSAGE

The overall brand message should communicate:

NEBA CAFÉ

Good Food. Great Moments. Simply NEBA.

A modern café ordering experience designed to make discovering, ordering, paying, and tracking your food simple.

Supporting ORNIX-TECH message:

Built professionally by ORNIX-TECH — from business requirements to real-world software.

65. FINAL REQUIREMENT

The result must be a complete, polished, responsive, production-oriented web application, not merely a collection of static pages.

Prioritize:

Functionality + UX + Architecture + Security + Maintainability + Professional Visual Design

The five-stage ORNIX-TECH process must be visible throughout the project.

The final product should demonstrate that ORNIX-TECH can take a real business problem and transform it into a professional software product:

Understand → Design → Architect → Build → Test → Deploy → Improve

## Overview

This project is a modern, responsive frontend implementation and interactive demonstration of the **NEBA Café Ordering & Management System**, powered by ORNIX-TECH.
